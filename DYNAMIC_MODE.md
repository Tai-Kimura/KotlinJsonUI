# Dynamic Mode Implementation Plan

## Overview
Dynamic Mode is a feature that enables real-time UI updates in the KotlinJsonUI app without rebuilding. This allows developers to see changes instantly as they edit JSON files.

## Current Implementation (Static Mode)
- **Build Process**: `kjui build` command generates Kotlin code from JSON files
- **Compilation**: UI is fixed at compile time
- **Updates**: Requires app rebuild and restart to see JSON changes
- **Use Case**: Production builds where UI doesn't need to change

## Dynamic Mode (To Be Implemented)
- **Local Server**: Monitors JSON file changes in real-time
- **Client-Server Communication**: App connects to local server to receive updates
- **Hot Reload**: UI updates automatically when JSON files are modified
- **No Rebuild Required**: Changes are reflected immediately without recompilation
- **Use Case**: Development and testing phase for rapid iteration

## Key Benefits
1. **Instant Feedback**: See UI changes immediately after saving JSON
2. **Faster Development**: No need to rebuild/restart the app for each change
3. **Better Testing**: Quickly test different UI configurations
4. **Design Iteration**: Designers can adjust UI without developer intervention

## Technical Components Needed
1. **Local Development Server**
   - File system watcher for JSON changes
   - WebSocket or HTTP endpoint for serving JSON
   - Change notification system

2. **App Client Integration**
   - Network client for server communication
   - Dynamic UI renderer that interprets JSON at runtime
   - State management for hot reload

3. **Mode Toggle**
   - Ability to switch between Static and Dynamic modes
   - Configuration to specify server URL/port
   - Debug UI to show connection status

## Implementation Status
- ✅ Static Mode: Fully implemented
- ⏳ Dynamic Mode: Planning phase

## Notes
- Dynamic Mode is for development only
- Production apps should use Static Mode for performance
- Consider security implications of loading UI from network
